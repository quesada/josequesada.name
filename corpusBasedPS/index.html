        <p align="justify">The objective of this page is to create a community 
          of modellers using the same datasets and explaining the same phenomena. 
          In computational linguistics, it is common practice to share datasets, 
          and we believe this would be the case also for problem solving. It is 
          easy to find datasets for things like chess, go, etc., but not so easy 
          to find logs of complex, dynamic tasks such as the ones offered in the 
          site. </p>
        <p align="justify">Having a common set of effects and data would facilitate 
          model comparison. We expect this site to be open to the problem solving 
          community, with new corpora being contributed by researchers around 
          the world. Please contact me If you have any corpora that you would 
          like to upload, or any questions about the ones offered here.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">Fierchief-1 Dataset<a name="firechief1"></a></h2>
        <h3 align="justify">Task description</h3>
        <p align="justify">Firechief (Omodei &amp; Wearing, 1995) simulates a 
          forest where a fire is spreading. Participants&#8217; task is to extinguish 
          the fire as soon as possible. In order to do so, they can use helicopters 
          and trucks (each one with particular characteristics) that can be controlled 
          by mouse movements and key presses. There are three commands that are 
          used to control the movement and functions of the appliances: (1) Drop 
          water on the current landscape segment; (2) Start a control fire (trucks 
          only) on the current landscape segment; (3) Move an appliance to a specified 
          landscape segment.</p>
        <p align="justify">Every time a participant performs an action, it is 
          saved in a log file as a row containing action number, command (e.g. 
          drop water or move) or event (e.g., a wind change or a new fire), current 
          performance score, appliance number, appliance type, position, and landscape 
          type. Most of these variables are not continuous, but on a nominal scale, 
          such as type of movement. For more information on the structure of the 
          log files, see Omodei and Wearing (1995).<br>

        <p align="justify">There is a newer version of Firechef, called Networked 
          Firechef; it can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/psy/research/cdrg/nfc.html">Complex 
          Decision Research Group </a>at La Trobe. the map can be a lot larger

        <h3 align="justify">Dataset description</h3>
        <p align="justify">To create an LPSA space, data from experiments 1 and 
          2 described in Quesada et al. (2000) were used as the corpus, plus data 
          from the experiment described in Ca&ntilde;as et al. (2003). The experiments 
          were designed to test hypothesis about cognitive flexibility when facing 
          new, changing conditions after training under constant conditions in 
          the dynamic task Firechief. Thus, the experiments consisted of a long 
          period of environmental constant conditions followed by a short period 
          of variable conditions. The conditions manipulated were wind direction 
          and fire extinguishing efficiency of the appliances. Since here we are 
          interested in a sample of representative behavior when interacting with 
          the system, the actual hypothesis and design of the former experiments 
          are not relevant.</p>

        <h3 align="justify">Task description</h3>
        <p align="justify">. An example of this kind of tasks is DURESS (DUal 
          REServoir System). DURESS is a thermal-hydraulic process control simulation 
          that was designed to be representative of Industrial process control 
          systems. It consists of two redundant feedwater streams that can be 
          configured to supply either, both or neither of the two reservoirs. 
          The goals of the game is to keep each of the reservoir temperatures 
          (T1 and T2) at a prescribed level (e.g., 40 C and 20 C, respectively), 
          and to satisfy the current mass (water) output demand (5 liters per 
          second and 7 liters per second, respectively). Thanks to the seminar 
          work of Vicente and collaborators (Christoffersen, Hunter, &amp; Vicente, 
          1996, 1997, 1998), the equivalent of three years of experience with 
          the system DURESS II is available and we used it in our LPSA simulations.

        The Research Flight Simulator form the National aerospace laboratory (<a href="http://www.nlr.nl/public/">NLR)</a>

        <h3 align="justify">Dataset description</h3>
        <p align="justify">The dataset consists of 400 landings performed by professional 
          pilots, with grades given by two human experts (instructors). The data 
          were collected at the NLR (national simulation facility) in Amsterdam 
          (Neederlands).</p>
        <p align="justify">The dataset was generated using two experts that graded 
          landings in different wind conditions. The experts used the following 
          criteria: (1) Flare initiation height: The flare has to be initiated 
          at a particular height; this height is not rigid as lower flares can 
          be compensated by a higher pitch rate for example. Three levels (too 
          high, correct, and too slow) were used. (2) Thrust Reduction: The reduction 
          should be progressive, and it has to be started in a particular moment 
          in time. It was judged using three levels: (too fast, correct, and too 
          slow). (3) Pitch rate. The pitch was evaluated using five discrete levels, 
          from too high to too low. (4) Overall landing score. This is a general 
          rating that expressed how good the landing was, from one to five. </p>
        <p align="justify">The variables logged in the simulator were the following:</p>

        <h2>Pipes-1 Dataset<a name="pipes1"></a></h2>
        <h3>Task description</h3>
        <p align="justify">A pipes participant plays the role of a water purification 
          plant operator. In this plant, water enters different purification tanks, 
          which the operator then activates while attempting to meet a set of 
          deadlines. <br>
          the figure shows a screenshot of pipes, which contains 22 tanks with 
          2 pumps per tank; a set of deadlines is visible on the right of the 
          screen. The tanks are connected by pipes that indicate the path the 
          water traverses to reach the deadline. The set of connected tanks is 
          called a chain, and the length of the chain dictates the amount of time 
          required to pump the water out of the system. The operator must remove 
          the water that enters the various tanks at different times as the simulation 
          advances. The operator&#8217;s goal is to distribute all the water within 
          the allotted amount of time by activating and deactivating the pumps 
          assigned to each tank. Only 5 pumps can be activated at any one time, 
          and after a pump is used there is a delay of 10 simulation minutes (cleaning 
          time) before this pump (or a different one) can be re-activated. The 
          simulation time begins at 2 o&#8217;clock and finishes at 10 o&#8217;clock 
          when the final deadline expires.</p>
