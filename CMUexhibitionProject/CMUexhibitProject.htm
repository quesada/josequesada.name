      <p><b>Note: this is an exhibition project. There are completed paintings, 
        unfinished paintings, and preparatory photos with descriptions of the 
        final work. All this will change at some point. I'll try to keep this 
        site updated. I'm also writing an article on &quot;exporters of cool&quot; 
        that can be used to motivate this exhibition. It will be linked as soon 
        as I finish it.</b></p>

      <p>&quot;I paint video-game characters. They are carefully designed to be 
        cool, sexy, appealing in any way imaginable. Since they are part of a 
        virtual reality, their whole environment can be created and recreated 
        at whim. If they are 'transplanted' to the frozen, time-less world of 
        the 'oil on canvas', something magic happens: they are no longer that 
        different form the flesh-and-bone people that inhabit reality.&quot;</p>

      <p>I'm interested in the contrast of &quot;coolness&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot;. 
        Most people, if asked, would agree in that art should be beautiful. Kitsch 
        art has the most powerful reflection on &quot;beauty&quot;, showing that 
        extremely ugly things can &quot;turn around the score&quot; and become 
        beautiful. Contemporary trends in TV (Reality shows, variety shows with 
        &quot;freaks&quot;) show that people may tire of prefabricated, higly-selected 
        objects of desire (e.g., top models), and may enjoy theirselves more when 
        the display shows mundane, somewhat ugly, but closer, &quot;normal person&quot;. 
        That is, bad taste could easily become mainstream, and in some countries 
        (for example, Spain) is.</p>
      <p>On a related topic, I'm interested in the process of selection that happens 
        when the artist presents some object to the public. Richter postulated 
        that we could eliminate the selection process in painting. He showed that 
        he aparently didn't care about what topic he was painting. In my opinion, 
        Richter's work is not a discourse about the idea of selection, but a reflection 
        on representation, and why it is still worthwhile to paint in the 21st 
        century.</p>
      <p>In my work, I use photographies too. They can be my own, or any other 
        published picutre, from fancy fashion photography to amateur out-of-focus, 
        red-eyed shots of best friends in parties. They can also be screen captures 
        of videogames or other virtual reality situations that are heavily designed 
        for a sophisticated public that consumes them in huge amounts. I'm interested 
        in the borders of the concept of reality, or 'realistic representation', 
        and how people buy conciously this lie. For example, today we all look 
        at photographs, movies, vector graphics, etc. and get caught in the fiction 
        without asking; this was absolutely impossible in the 18th century, where 
        painting was the only mean to represent reality visually.</p>
      <p>One basic motif how art can make the most real-life of situations unreal: 
        for example by grabbing real people and make them look as sketches of 
        fiction anime characters, in the 'japanese teens' series of drawings. 
        These people are real, but they have internalized so many stereotypes 
        from the ficticious world of Manga and design in their attempt to be 'cool', 
        that they look unreal. </p>
      <p>Most of the work I present here are representations of representations. 
        I like to play with the concept of representation (as presented in Palmer, 
        1978), and I use painting and drawing because they come with a huge collection 
        of preconceived ideas that can be exploited in the expectator to produce 
        the effect that I want.</p>
