<h1 class=t0><strong>R-vim suite</strong></h1>
<p class=t0>There are many good editors for R (<a href="http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/projects/Editors.html" target="http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/projects/Editors.html ">Here</a>
  is a list). However, I prefer to write R code with vim for many reasons. </p>
<ul class=t1>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>fast opening and closing. Ideal for notes and short idea proofs
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>best search (highlight of items found) that I know in any editor
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>word completion (a la intellisense)
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>extensible
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>multiplatform
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>free, open source
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>large community
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>I'll never outgrow it
</li>
<li class=t1><p class=t1>Fun. Watching a vim guru editing text, one wonders if he has some
superpowers and is controlling the text with his mind, not his fingers.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the vim support for R was a simple syntax file, and not very
detailed. So I added the features that I was needing and made them available
here.</p>

<p class=t2><strong>Better syntax highighting with different colors for types</strong>
  (e.g., matrix, character, etc) functions (e.g., abs, c, etc) and packages. All
  this is in a vim syntax file, <a href="r.vim.html">r.vim</a>. Simply copy
  it into your syntax folder in $VIM/, or in windows $VIM/vimfiles (where $VIM
  is the base directory where vim is installed). I have tested it with vim 7.0d
  only, but being a simple syntax file it should work with any version.</p>
<p class=t2>The keywords for functions and packages are adapted from the ones
  <a href="http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/projects/R.syn">here.</a> </p>
<div align="center">
  <table width="75%" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td><div align="center">Here is a picture of how the syntax looks (using
          peachpuff colors):</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div align="center"><img src="synHLscreenshot-small.png" width="495" height="480"></div></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p class=t2><strong>Code templates [TODO]</strong> in tSkeleton from Rlanguage.tcl.
  Everytime one creates a new R file with :new a header with personal data appears
  in the comments, and a small template for loading raw data. </p>
<p class=t2>The templates are adapted from the ones that Philippe Grosjean (phgrosjean@sciviews.org)
  created for textPad. To adapt them for vim, I have used TSkeleton.vim and imap.vim.
  You can get them at http://www.vim.org </p>
<p class=t2> <strong>Hotkey to send code from Vim to R</strong>. This is an autohotkey
  script. Autohotkey is a windows scripting language that is based on GUIs and
  global keystroke plus mouse events. It is a very simple way to connect applications.
  The script is <a href="SendCodeToR.ahk">Here</a>. You will need <a href="www.autoHotkey.com" >autoHotkey,
  </a>a free keyboard macro program. Supports hotkeys for keyboard, mouse, and
  joystick. Can expand abbreviations as you type them.</p>
<p class=t2>In my case, I use F3, but thiscan easily be redefined. If you do not
  want to download autohotkey, you can always use <a href="SendCodeToR.exe" target="SendCodeToR.exe">this
  executable</a>. It works as an icon in the system tray. Simply keep it in any
  directory and ask windows to run it everytime it starts. The disadvantage to
  using the executable is that you cannot change the hotkey. For this to work
  R must be in SDI mode (Edit > preferences > click on the SDI radio button).It
  may work in MDI mode, but I haven't tried. </p>
<p class=t2>You have to launch R and wait for the console to be ready before you hit
the hotkey to send text.
</p>
<p class=t2>The way it works: </p>
<p class=t2>1. Select a block of R code (it can be the whole file). It can be
  in vim, but the beauty of this is that it works in any other application, including
  the very own R help window that always displays examples.</p>
<p class=t2> 2. Hit F3 </p>
<p class=t2>3. The code will be executed by R, and the focus will be back to the
  original window (e.g., the editor).</p>
<p class=t2> 4. Keep editing code with minimal distraction. </p>
<p class=t2>If you need help, drop me a line.</p>
