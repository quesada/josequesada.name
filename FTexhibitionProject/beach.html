  <p>[TOP] Jose Quesada, Beach (2000) 120 x 42 cm, 47 x 16.5 inch. Oil on canvas</p>
  <p>The virtual girl (from the videogame &quot;dead or alive&quot;) stares nonchalantly 
    towards a spanish beach. The contrast between her perfect, designed body and 
    the mundane images of fat ladies under horrible umbrellas spreading lotion 
    over their voluminous bodies is striking. The whole composition takes the 
    attention of the espectator to the right, but the gaze of the girl returns 
    it to the center.</p>
