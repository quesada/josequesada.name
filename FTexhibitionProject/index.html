          version of the proposal</a></font></font></b></font></p>
        <p><b>Note: this is an exhibition project. There are completed paintings, 
          unfinished paintings, and preparatory photos with descriptions of the 
          final work. This proposal is also presented as a web site, of which 
          you are holding a paper version now. The preparatory photos are marked 
          as (in preparation*). There isn't really that much difference between 
          the final painting (oil on canvas) and the photo, so I have presented 
          the photos to give a better idea of what the exhibition is all about. 
          I think the topic treated in this proposal can be particularly appropriate 
          for the Future Tenant art gallery and its expected audience in the technological 
          and cultural environment of Pittsburgh.</b></p>

        <p> I paint video-game characters. They are carefully designed to be <em>cool</em>, 
          sexy, appealing in any way imaginable. Since they are part of a virtual 
          reality, their whole environment can be created and recreated at whim. 
          If they are 'transplanted' to the frozen, time-less world of the 'oil 
          on canvas', something magic happens: they are no longer that different 
          form the flesh-and-bone people that inhabit reality characters, movie 
          characters,etc have a very short life span: they are ephemera. However, 
          people associate traditional forms of art (e.g., oil on canvas) with 
          transcendence, historical value, immortality. In my work, I play with 
          the juxtaposition of these stereotypes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>See the following definitions from dictionary.com :<br>
        <em>Sophistication</em><br>
        1. To cause to become less natural, especially to make less naive and 
        more worldly.<br>
        2. To make impure; adulterate.<br>
        3. To make more complex or inclusive; refine.</p>
      <p><em>cool</em><br>
        1. Fashionable: conforming to the custom, fashion , or established mode<br>
        2. NONCHALANT stresses an easy coolness of manner or casualness that suggests 
        indifference or unconcern<br>
        3. dandy, divine, glorious, groovy, hunky-dory, keen, nifty, sensational, 
        swell. </p>
      <p>Art has become more sophisticated with evolution, and as such, more dependent 
        on the context. Recent pieces of art have no meaning unless they are understood 
        in their cultural context, e.g., John Cage's allegoric compositions. Current 
        exhibitions in main modern art museums are not understood by people with 
        no background in history of art (context). Installations, videos, conceptual 
        art... are strange to people, who enjoy more their newspaper comic strips. 
        Since other modern, non-artistic cultural phenomena of our time are very 
        context-dependent too, art is losing its privileged status and becoming 
        mainstream in those popular elements: movies, comics, and lately, videogames. 
        The amount of effort invested in research on human behavior and design 
        in videogames is surprising. The final objective of these efforts is to 
        fabricate <em>cool:</em> a temporal, perishable good that is easily understood 
        and appreciated by the general public that doesn't understand what's inside 
        the museums. </p>
      <p> This is an after-pop and after-Kitsch criterion for art value. 
      <p>Current art merit criteria have less to do with beauty and more to do 
        with <em>cool</em> . 
      <p>I'm interested in the contrast of &quot;<em>coolness</em>&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot;. 
        Most people, if asked, would agree in that art should be beautiful. Kitsch 
        art has the most powerful reflection on &quot;beauty&quot;, showing that 
        extremely ugly things can &quot;turn around the score&quot; and become 
        beautiful. Contemporary trends in TV (Reality shows, variety shows with 
        &quot;freaks&quot;) show that people may tire of prefabricated, highly-selected 
        objects of desire (e.g., top models), and may enjoy their selves more 
        when the display shows mundane, somewhat ugly, but closer, &quot;normal 
        person&quot;. That is, bad taste could easily become mainstream, and in 
        some countries (for example, Spain) is.</p>
      <p>On a related topic, I'm interested in the process of selection that happens 
        when the artist presents some object to the public. Richter postulated 
        that we could eliminate the selection process in painting. He showed that 
        he apparently didn't care about what topic he was painting. In my opinion, 
        Richter's work is not a discourse about the idea of selection, but a reflection 
        on representation, and why it is still worthwhile to paint in the 21st 
        century.</p>
      <p>In my work, I use photography too. It can be my own, or any other published 
        picture, from fancy fashion photography to amateur out-of-focus, red-eyed 
        shots of best friends in parties. They can also be screen captures of 
        videogames or other virtual reality situations that are heavily designed 
        for a sophisticated public that consumes them in huge amounts. I'm interested 
        in the borders of the concept of reality, or 'realistic representation', 
        and how people buy consciously this lie. For example, today we all look 
        at photographs, movies, vector graphics, etc. and get caught in the fiction 
        without asking; this was absolutely impossible in the 18th century, where 
        painting was the only mean to represent reality visually.</p>
      <p>One basic motif how art can make the most real-life of situations unreal: 
        for example by grabbing real people and make them look as sketches of 
        fiction anime characters, in the 'japanese teens' series of drawings. 
        These people are real, but they have internalized so many stereotypes 
        from the fictitious world of Manga and design in their attempt to be '<em>cool</em>', 
        that they look unreal. </p>
      <p>Most of the work I present here are representations of representations. 
        I like to play with the concept of representation (as presented in Palmer, 
        1978), and I use painting and drawing because they come with a huge collection 
        of preconceived ideas that can be exploited in the spectator to produce 
        the effect that I want.</p>
