  <p>[TOP] Jose Quesada, random-silly-pic-001, (in preparation*), Oil on canvas, 
    30 x 30 cm, 12 x 12 inch</p>
  <p>I don't know the person on the picture, nor the photographer, it is simply 
    a really bad photo with no artistic pretensions. Transforming this subject 
    into an artistic object (classical oil-on-canvas) transmits the ideas that 
    the theme is not important, anything is &quot;paintable&quot;. My idea is 
    to collect several amateur pictures, possibly online, and use convert them 
    into paintings.</p>
