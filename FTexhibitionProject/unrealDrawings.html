<p align="center">These are real people in the streets of the neighborhood of 
  Harajuku, Tokio! </p>
<p align="center">Many say their parents don't approve so they meet and make a 
  performance out of transforming into their characters with make up and costume. 
  These Japanese, who are traditionally shy, completely become someone else being 
  in public (which is raised to a performance art). In Western countries, the 
  closest thing that we can enjoy to this display are Drag Queens.</p>
<p align="center">But I digress. These people are manga -fied. The idea here is 
  to try to draw them in an sketchy but realistic way (simply pencil on white 
  continuous paper). They will be drawn in real-life size. Although they are real 
  people drawn in real-life size the spectator will still probably assume that 
  they are just some large sketckes for some manga characters.That is, we are 
  playing with the fact that drawing (sketching) is easily associated with invention, 
  a way of materialze things that are only in the mind. This people may look invented 
  even when drawn very realistically.</p>
<p align="center">NOTE: This pictures are not mine, but photographer Shoichi Aoki's. 
  Technically, I shouldn't even have them online. They will be replaced with the 
  drawings as soon as I complete them, or the publisher's lawyer calls :). These 
  are not the final figures, I may change them.</p>
