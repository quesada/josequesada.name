  <p>[TOP] Jose Quesada, Untitled (2000), 68 x 28 cm, 27 x 10.6 inch, Oil on canvas 
  </p>
  <p>The couple depicted is taken from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. They are 
    videogame characters, painted using the most traditional technique (oil on 
    canvas). The middle landscape is a copy of a Richter painting. He used a photograpy 
    to create his painting. The three parts are, then, representations of a representation.</p>
  <p>As you probably know, Richter claims to be &quot;indifferent&quot; to subject 
    matter. However, following his work in his atlas project and in what he actually 
    ends up painting, one can see that this indifference is utopic. Richter did 
    select his themes, although his criteria may be really obscure. In my case, 
    I just found the whole &quot;romanticism&quot; of the Richter painting funny 
    when put in between these two virtual reality lovers. In an stretch of the 
    Kitsch ideals, everything in this painting is exquisitely &quot;artificial&quot;. 
    We all (the designers of the characters, Richter, me) fake not to care for 
    some ideals, but we do.</p>
