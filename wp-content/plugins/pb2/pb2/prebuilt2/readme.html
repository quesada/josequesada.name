<!--Introduction-->
<h2>Introduction</h2>Prebuilt for Wordpress is an entirely new way to look at a Wordpress theme. There are many, many, wonderful Wordpress themes available today, and when creating Prebuilt we thought of just that. That's why we set out to create not an amazing theme, but a theme that was functional and clean, while at the same time, helping you learn Wordpress.<br /><br />
The theme was built by Astereostudio, the same person behind Devlounge. The intent
was for Prebuilt to go hand in hand with the Devlounge Series, &quot;Customizing Wordpress&quot;,
which was a 4 part series on using the total power of Wordpress.

<h2>Installation</h2>Installation is fairly simple. It is much like you'd install any other Wordpress theme.
<ul>
  <li>Extract the prebuilt zip to a folder somewhere on your desktop.</li>
  <li>Upload entire prebuilt folder as is to ...&quot;wp-content/themes/&quot;, leaving
    the structure as is.</li>
  <li>To make things easier, change permissions on header, footer, index, and
    style to 666 or higher.</li>
</ul>

Once you have uploaded everything, head to the Wordpress Presentation tab, under themes, select "Prebuilt". Your new theme will no be active.

<h2>Built In Plugin Support</h2>
With the release of Prebuilt 2, the need for built in plugins is no longer important.
Using widgets, we can accomplish almost all of what we could with plugins. Open
up the plugins folder and upload the flickrss plugin and widgets folder to ...&quot;wp-content/plugins/"

<h2>Flickr Integration</h2>
Flickr photos are automatically built into the Prebuilt design, by using the Flickrss plugin. You can manage your photos and settings after installing and activating the flickrss plugin by going to Options > Flickrss.

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
You will also notice, by default, there is a large empty grey space next to flickr images. (In PB2, this has been replaced with an area for you to add an author picture and description - but same concept). At first, we planned to put certain features here, but after thought, we decided that we should leave it open to you to insert your own features. Scared of code? We will be showcasing a variety of samples of what you can put here in the upcoming weeks. If you have nothing to put there for now, try typing up a description in place of the dummy text there by default.

<h2>Stylesheet</h2>
You'll notice that Prebuilt is a fairly image-less design. The image folder uploaded
along with the theme contains few images, and most of the site is css-based.
We worked hard to organize the css so it is easy to understand and easy to change. In PB2, we've made it even easier for you, by adding 3 stylesheets. To chose between then, go to Presentation > Customize Prebuilt (Prebuilt must be activated in order to see this tab).

<h2>Extensive Documentation</h2>

  Wordpress. Take a look at our articles for more:</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
At this time, support for Prebuilt is limited. Because of the nature of my work
(Student, Freelance Designer, and managing 3 sites), I can not support the project
as much as I'd like to. I will give support whenever I can. Please use the links
