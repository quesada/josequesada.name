Prevents WordPress 2.1+ from adding a more link to your website's feed.

== Description ==

WordPress 2.1 introduces a nasty "feature" to feeds. Instead of abiding by your feed preferences, WordPress will truncate your feedâ€™s content anywhere you insert a &lt;!--more--&gt; tag. Full Text Feed undos this functionality, allowing your feeds to contain the full text regardless of &lt;!--more--&gt; usage.

== Installation ==

Unzip full_feed.zip, drop the full_feed.php file into /wp-content/plugins/, and activate the plugin.
