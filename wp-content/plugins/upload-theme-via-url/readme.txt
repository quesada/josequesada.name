Upload and install themes and plugins from URL.

== Description ==

"Install via URL" is a plugin which allows it's users to upload and install themes/plugins only by having URL. This simple feature is sometimes extremely useful. Writing this plugin took me more than 2 days, I had to study WordPress php code to somehow join my code to it. Sorry for my horrible english, but im still learning it :)  

So far plugin supports only zip extenstion but im currently working on allowing to use rar extension. Also im working on translations
